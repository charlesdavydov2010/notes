- "Today's programming wisdom: 'Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.' — Leonardo da Vinci. In coding, always strive to write clean, simple, and maintainable code. Complexity often breeds bugs and confusion. The best solutions are those that are easily understood and can be built upon. Remember, you're not just writing code for computers to execute but also for fellow humans to read, review, and extend in the future." 

"Also, 'Premature optimization is the root of all evil.' – Donald Knuth. Focus on making your code correct first, then optimize if and where necessary. Don't over-engineer from the start; instead, let performance requirements guide targeted optimizations." 

"Lastly, 'Code is read much more often than it is written.' Always keep this in mind when deciding how to structure and document your work."
