- "Today's programming wisdom is to focus on writing clean, readable, and maintainable code. It's not just about making it work, but also about making it easy for others (and your future self) to understand and modify. Invest time in planning, documenting, and testing your code. Remember that programming is a collaborative effort, and your code will have a longer lifespan if it's built with care and consideration for others who may interact with it."
